# Inventor Kit Experiments

### Say "Hello" to the BBC micro:bit ###

(Code for experiment one)

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned what a microbit was, and all the capabilities and potential that the small little device can have. It is very interesting, I learnt that LED's on the screen can change, and that the microbit can move motors and make sounds aswell.  

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a billboard where pixels light up on the screen. These pixels might only light up when the car triggers a sensor, that way the billboard isn't wasting unnecessary power. They could have cameras on the side of the road that looked into the car to create different advertisements on the billboard based on who is travelling. If the camera noticed a family, they could advertise a family meal at a stop nearby. However, if it is just one person in the vechile, the billboard could create an advertisement of just a singular item. 

### Using a light sensor and analog inputs ###
